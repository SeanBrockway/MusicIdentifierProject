# Music Identifier Project
This project was for my final year in Edge Hill University. It involves the development of a classifier using Python that can recommend workout music provided that some prior user knowledge (such as an users playlist) is known. 

## Abstract from Dissertation 
"Whether it’s tailored music recommendations or monitoring regional listening activity, data analysis has become an undeniably essential tool that has contributed to the global success of music streaming. However, there is a lack of publicly available academic sources and research exploring the relationship between audio properties, listening data and listening activity. Because of this, the analytical processes of streaming services remain enigmatic. In this paper, a random forest classifier was trained using 6,000 songs from Gym playlists and 6,000 songs from Relax and Sleep playlists to analyse the audio features of songs to predict its suitability for training and exercising to. The classifier was a success and was applied in hypothetical use cases to generate a list of recommended workout music based on the music in a single playlist."
